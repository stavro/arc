  * Require Elixir v1.4
  * Relax package dependencies
  * Fix Elixir v1.4 warnings
  * (Enhancement) Disable asynchronous processing via module attribute `@async false`.

  * (Enhancement) Allow asset host to be set via an environment variable
  * (Enhancement) Allow downloading and saving remote files
  * (Enhancement) Move Arc storage module to config
  * (Bugfix) Split conversion arguments correctly when a file name has a space in it

## v0.6.0-rc1 (2016-10-04)
  * (Dependencies) - Removed `httpoison` as an optional dependency, added `sweet_xml` and `hackney` as optional dependencies (required if using S3).
  * (Enhancement) File streaming to S3 - Allows the uploading of large files to S3 without reading to memory first.
  * (Enhancement) Allow Arc to transform and store directly on binary input.
  * (Bugfix - backwards incompatible) Return error tuple rather than raising `Arc.ConvertError` if the transformation fails.
  * (Bugfix) Update `:crypto` usage to `:crypto.strong_rand_bytes`
  * (Enhancement) Optionally set S3 bucket from runtime env var  (`config :arc, bucket: {:system, "S3_BUCKET"}`)

  * (Enhancement) Relax ex_aws dependency to allow `~> 0.5.0`

## v0.5.2 (2016-04-27)
  * (Enhancement) Allow returning a list of arguments for transformations to preserve desired groupings.

## v0.5.1 (2016-03-02)
  * (Enhancement) Raise a more helpful error message when attempting a transformation with an executable which cannot be found.

## v0.5.0 (2016-03-02)
  * (Enhancement) Allow transforms via arbitrary system executables.
  * (Enhancement) Allow transforms to supply a function to define the transformation args.
  * (Deprecation) Deprecate usage of {:noaction} in favor of :noaction for transformation responses.

Upgrade instructions from 0.4.x to 0.5.x:

Arc now favors explicitness in file extension changes rather than scanning with a Regex.  If you have a `convert` transformation which changes the file extension (through the parameter `-format png` argument), you must explicitly add a third tuple argument in the conversion noting the final extension.

Example:

```elixir
# Change this:
  def transform(:thumb, _) do
    {:convert, "-strip -thumbnail 250x250^ -gravity center -extent 250x250 -format png"}
  end

# To this:
  def transform(:thumb, _) do
    {:convert, "-strip -thumbnail 250x250^ -gravity center -extent 250x250 -format png", :png} #<--- Note the third tuple argument with the output file extension
  end
```


## v0.4.1 (2016-02-28)
  * (Bugfix) Fix regression using the local filesystem introduced via v0.4.0.

## v0.4.0 (2016-02-25)
  * (Bugfix) Surface errors from ExAws put operations.  Parse ExAws errors and return tuple of form `{:error, List.t}` when an error is encountered.

To upgrade and properly support parsing aws errors, add `:poison` to your list of dependencies.

> Optional dependency added, prompting a minor version bump.  While not a strict backwards incompatibility, Arc users should take note of the change as more than an internal change.

## v0.3.0 (2016-01-22)
  * (Enhancement) Introduce `Definition.delete/2`

> While there is no strict backwards incompatibility with the public API, a number of users have been using `Arc.Storage.S3.delete/3` as a public API due to a lack of a fully supported delete method.  This internal method has now changed slightly, thus prompting more than a patch release.

## v0.2.3 (2016-01-22)
  * (Enhancement) Allow specifying custom s3 object headers through the definition module via `s3_object_headers/2`.

## v0.2.2 (12-14-2015)
  * (Enhancement) Allow the version transformation and storage timeout to be specified in configuration `config :arc, version_timeout: 15_000`.

## v0.2.1 (12-11-2015)
  * (Bugfix) Raise `Arc.ConvertError` if ImageMagick's `convert` tool exits unsuccessfully.

## v0.2.0 (12-11-2015)
  * (Breaking Change) Erlcloud has been removed in favor of ExAws.
  * (Enhancement) Added a configuration parameter to generate urls in the `virtual_host` style.

### Upgrade Instructions
Since `erlcloud` has been removed from `arc`, you must also remove it from your dependency graph as well as your application list. In its place, add `ex_aws` and `httpoison` to your dependencies as well as application list. Next, remove the aws credential configuration from arc:

```elixir
# BEFORE
config :arc,
  access_key_id: "###",		
  secret_access_key: "###",		
  bucket: "uploads"

#AFTER
config :arc,
  bucket: "uploads"

# (this is the default ex_aws config... if your keys are not in environment variables you can override it here)
config :ex_aws,
  access_key_id: [{:system, "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"}, :instance_role],
  secret_access_key: [{:system, "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"}, :instance_role]
```

## v0.1.4 (11-10-2015)
  * (Enhancement: Local Storage) Filenames which contain path separators will flatten out as expected prior to moving copying the file to its destination.

## v0.1.3 (09-15-2015)

  * (Enhancement: Url Generation) `default_url/2` introduced to definition module which passes the given scope as the second parameter.  Backwards compatibility is maintained for `default_url/1`.

## v0.1.2 (09-08-2015)

  * (Bugfix: Storage) Bugfix for referencing atoms in the file name.

## v0.1.1

  * (Enhancement: Storage) Add the local filesystem as a storage option.
